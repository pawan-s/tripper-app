                      <p>This is an example of tab bar application layout. The main point of such tabbed layout is that each tab contains independent view with its own routing and navigation.</p>
                      <p>Each tab/view may have different layout, different navbar type (dynamic, fixed or static) or without navbar like this tab.</p>
                      <p>And of course, your favorite panels are still here: <a href="#" class="open-panel">left</a> and  <a href="#" data-panel="right" class="open-panel">right</a></p>
                      <p>Icons and their labels in tab bar below are just for example and don't related to their content.</p>
